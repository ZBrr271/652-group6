The song is from the point of view of anti-hero Pink during a hallucination, in which he becomes a fascist dictator and turns a concert audience into an angry mob. He sends the mob out to raid nearby neighborhoods that are full of minorities.

The music was written by David Gilmour (one of the three songs on The Wall for which Gilmour wrote music), while the lyrics were by Roger Waters alone. <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/Pink+Floyd/_/Run+Like+Hell"">Read more on Last.fm</a>."

As the title suggests, it concerns the thoughts of a dying atheist, scared by his non-belief in an afterlife. Now, at the moment of his death, he must face the disheartening non-existence he will soon inhabit. 

Just before the bridge, at 2:04, Wolstenholme can be heard jumping into the pool at Grouse Lodge recording studio as Howard hits his cymbals.
